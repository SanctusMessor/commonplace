### Capture the Flag / Hands On <a id="capture-the-flag-hands-on"></a>

After reading theory, and perhaps running specific examples or labs, I like to practice in slightly more open environments. Here are the ones I have enjoyed the best, keeping in mind that there are many more available than I will ever have time to try. If something sounds interesting - try it!

[Over the wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) - Natas is great for web pen testing, and the rest for coming up to speed on things like buffer overflow and memory corruption. I haven't completed everything on the site, but I always learned a lot. All the challenges are free.

[Pentester lab](ttps://www.pentesterlab.com/) - an excellent site for learning, with a structured approach and courses. Unfortunately, it's a modest investment on an ongoing basis.

[Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) - Download lot's of \(Free!\) vulnerable VM's. If you are just starting out, try out the [Kioptrix](https://www.vulnhub.com/?q=kioptrix&sort=date-des) series \(1-5\), [Minotaur](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sectalks-bne0x00-minotaur,139/), [pwnlab](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/pwnlab-init,158/), [stapler](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/stapler-1,150/), and [VulnOS](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/vulnos-2,147/).

[Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) - One of my favorite sites. VPN into their network and have fun! There is a small hacking challenge to get an account. They have a Pro version, but the free one is plenty for part time learning.

[Fuzzy Security Tutorials](http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials.html) - More a mix of tutorial, VM exploit walkthroughs, and overviews of concepts - this site has many interesting resources for learning aspects of hacking.

Here are a few good cheat sheets: enumerate [network services](http://www.0daysecurity.com/penetration-testing/enumeration.html), [reverse shells](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet), and one for [privilege escalation](https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/) \(it's a little old, but still relevant - the methodology is what counts.\).
